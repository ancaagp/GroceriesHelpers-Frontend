**Groceries helpers** is social initiative that tries to help people in need with their groceries shopping and delivery. The project aims to respond to some of the needs caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, more specifically, to the shortage of safe food delivery. The platform connects people in need with those willing to offer help.

When you go out and do groceries shopping for yourself, why not buy something small for someone else who cannot leave the house?

**Features:**
